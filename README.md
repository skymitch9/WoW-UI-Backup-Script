# üíæ How to Update and Schedule Your WoW Backup Script

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 1: Download and Run the Script

### Download the Script from GitHub
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository where the `wowBackup.ps1` script is hosted.
2. Locate the `wowBackup.ps1` file in the repository.
3. To download the file:
   - Click on the file name `wowBackup.ps1`.
   - Click the **Raw** button to view the script in plain text.
   - Right-click on the page and select **Save As** to save the file to your local machine.
   - Save the file with the `.ps1` extension (e.g., `wowBackup.ps1`).

   Alternatively, you can:
   - Click the **Download ZIP** button (if available) in the repository to download all files.
   - Extract the ZIP and locate the `wowBackup.ps1` script.

### Edit the Script to Match Your Folders
You no longer need to manually update folder paths! The script will now prompt you to select your `Interface` and `WTF` folders and choose a backup destination. Here's how you can use the script:

1. **Select Folders When Running the Script**:
   - Upon execution, the script will prompt you to select the folder locations for your:
     - **Interface folder**
     - **WTF folder**
     - **Backup destination folder**

2. **Save the changes** if you made any modifications to the script, and you're ready to run it.

### Run the Script Manually

#### Open PowerShell as Administrator:
- Press `Win + X` and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

#### Temporarily bypass the script execution policy to allow it to run:
```powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass```
